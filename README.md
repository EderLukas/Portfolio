# Portfolio
I recently finished my apprenticeship in software development.
In this repository I would like to present some private and school projects.They give an impression of what was dealt with by the school subjects.

Thank you for your time and having a look. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Kind Regards
Lukas Eder
