# Portfolio

In this repository I would like to present some private and schoolprojects.
I am still in education and applying for jobs. It is difficult for companies
to get a grasp of what a programmer with no job experience is capable of. 
So I hope to give a better insight with this
portfolio.

Thank you for your time and having a look.
Best Regards
Lukas Eder
