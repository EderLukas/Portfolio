# Bash Scripts

The bash and batch module focuses on flowcharts and shell scripts on linux and windows operating systems.
In this folder you can find some bash scripts and also a "mini-game" which I created to put the learned
material to use.
The module is still ongoing and therefore you will not find any batch scripts yet.
