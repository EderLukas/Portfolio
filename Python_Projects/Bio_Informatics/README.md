# Bioinformatics and GC-content

This code basicly just reads a file, counts letters 
and does some simple percentage calculations.

In molecular biology and genetics they use a DNA sequencer to automate 
the DNA sequencing process. Out of this process, a file is generated.
The whole file consists of Gs, Cs, As, and Ts.
These letters stand for Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine and Thymine, which are the building-
blocks of DNA or genomes. DNA with low GC-content is less stable
than DNA with high GC-content. My little programme defines the GC-content.

For further reference I provide the links from where I got my information:
DNA-Sequencer - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencer
GC-content    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content

The files I took from this website:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore

Type into the search bar which genome you are looking for
and go to the FASTA file.

Example:
Search for the Ebola virus by typing ebola into the search bar. Klick on FASTA
of the first entry and you get to 
this page => https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AF086833.2?report=fasta
